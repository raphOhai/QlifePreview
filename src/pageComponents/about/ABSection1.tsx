                            Contrary to common misconceptions, primary healthcare is not &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; or &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; â€“ it represents the foundation of effective healthcare delivery. At this level, we can successfully manage 80% of the common health needs for 80% of the population, ensuring that only cases requiring specialized care are referred to secondary facilities.

                            This trend highlighted the public&rsquo;s lack of awareness about the critical importance of primary healthcare in maintaining overall well-being. Through our work, we aim to educate our community while providing the credibility and accountability that healthcare delivery demands.

                            We observed that many people in our environment bypass primary care and go straight to specialists, creating unnecessary strain on the healthcare system and often missing opportunities for preventive care.
